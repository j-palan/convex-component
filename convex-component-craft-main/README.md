# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Browser Use component – environment variables

**You do not need a `.env` in your project root for the Convex backend.** Convex runs your actions on Convex’s servers and only reads variables from the **Convex Dashboard**.

1. Open [dashboard.convex.dev](https://dashboard.convex.dev) → your project → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**.
2. Add:
   - `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`
   - `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `MODEL_API_KEY` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
3. Redeploy or run `npx convex dev` so the backend picks them up.

A root `.env` is only for your local dev server (e.g. Vite) and is **never** read by Convex. Keep API keys in the Convex Dashboard so they stay server-side and secure.
